This repository presents a computational pipeline for decoding different microstates of EEG signal. We have used HDP-HMM to find the microstates and SVM to decode these states. The current pipeline only decodes the spectral properties of the microstates. The requirements of this pipeline are:
*sklearn
*numpy
*pandas
*mne
*matplotlib
*bnpy
*seaborn
*hyperopt (Bayesian Hyperparameter Optimization)
